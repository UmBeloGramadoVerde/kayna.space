          This is just to sum up most projects I've done, so it is more
          convenient to show them to people, in order for me to convince them
          that I would be cool to work with. Give me money to make cool things.

          I'm pretty comfortable with back and front end (angular, react, node,
          python, Java, .NET). I can solve problems real good and learn things
          real fast.

          I'm interested in working with unformal, artistic,
          weird and creative projects.
          If you think I could help with something interesting you
